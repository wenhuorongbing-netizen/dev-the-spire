# Private Beta Release Checklist

Target mod: `EZ Micro Balance`
Target manifest id: `EZMicroBalance`

## Architecture

- [x] Existing `EzDailyContent` manifest id remains unchanged.
- [x] `EZMicroBalance` has its own manifest, project, code folder, resource folder, DLL, and PCK.
- [x] Enabling `EZMicroBalance` does not require enabling legacy `EzDailyContent`.
- [x] Custom-character work is not included in this private beta.
- [x] A11-A20 selection is now default-on in this private-beta multiplayer test candidate for single-player and host-multiplayer standard lobbies. Set `EZMB_ASCENSION_DISABLE_PUBLIC_SELECTION=1` to restore vanilla A1-A10 selection for comparison. Set `EZMB_ASCENSION_DISABLE_MULTIPLAYER_SELECTION=1` to disable only host-multiplayer A11-A20 selection. `EZMB_ASCENSION_ALLOW_PUBLIC_ASCENSION=1` is legacy-compatible and no longer required. Host multiplayer A20 selection/start logs a downgrade warning because Dual King Brands / second-boss Brand gameplay remains disabled or downgraded in co-op pending live verification. Full live Ascension and co-op verification is pending.

## Build And Publish

- [x] `dotnet build` succeeds.
- [x] `dotnet publish` succeeds.
- [x] Published `EZMicroBalance.json` exists.

- [x] Release artifact tests are opt-in with `EZMB_RUN_RELEASE_ARTIFACT_TESTS=1` after publish and package refresh.
- [x] Release artifact, installed DLL/PCK, package hash, and runtime-smoke evidence tests have been rerun for the current tree with `EZMB_RUN_RELEASE_ARTIFACT_TESTS=1` after the latest package hash refresh.
- [x] `publish/EZMicroBalance-v0.1.0-private-beta.0.zip` is rebuilt from the current installed artifacts. Current zip SHA256 `F09686BA68A8A63FEC716713C2B7A5D3A184F1FEE5EE1EB749BBD1AEDEB142FC`.

## Runtime

- [x] BaseLib appears in Mod Settings.
- [x] BaseLib loads when enabled in a controlled smoke profile.
- [x] EZ Micro Balance appears in Mod Settings.
- [x] EZ Micro Balance loads when enabled in a controlled smoke profile.
- [x] Game reaches main menu with only BaseLib and EZ Micro Balance enabled in the controlled smoke profile.
- [x] `godot.log` reviewed for controlled smoke-test initializer errors.
- [ ] `godot.log` reviewed after normal Steam-client manual verification.

## Content Verification

- [x] Every implemented Ancient reward change has a manual checklist row.
- [ ] Every implemented Ancient reward change has a completed manual runtime result.
- [ ] Save/load-sensitive behavior is tested.
- [ ] Disable-mod gameplay behavior is tested in a run.
- [ ] Multiplayer disposition is decided: verified, or release-noted as unsupported/unverified.
- [x] Rootblight I/II/III and Blight Sprout generated portrait art is integrated and packaged; live in-game visual verification remains part of the manual matrix.
- [x] Urda, Loamweaver has a source-backed first gameplay slice for Seedbed, Humus Pact, Molting, and Moss Map; live Urda gameplay and save/load checks remain pending.

## Release Hygiene

- [x] Debug probes are removed from active behavior or gated behind an explicit debug flag.
- [x] No original Slay the Spire 2 assets are included in the active `EZMicroBalance` publish package.
- [x] Active `mod_image.png` is original generated art with no text, numbers, logos, or official game assets.
- [x] No large decompiled game code bodies are copied into the active source.
- [x] Author placeholder is replaced for this private beta; `EZMicroBalance.json` author is `wenhuorongbing-netizen`.
- [ ] Worktree is clean.
- [ ] Commit is created.
- [ ] Push to `origin/main` is performed only after explicit user approval.

## Known Issues

- RC1 normal Steam-client Mod Settings verification passed after adding the no-op EZ Micro Balance BaseLib config page.
- Manual feature results are pending; `docs/features/ancients-rework-v4/manual-verification-matrix.md`, `docs/features/ancient-expansion-urda/manual-test-checklist.md`, and `docs/features/ascension-11-20/manual-test-checklist.md` remain the current manual surfaces.
- A11 source now inserts a reachable optional route node in the new column and adds Act 1/2/3 route rows, while ordinary A11 route nodes no longer receive a dedicated marker or hover tooltip. Natural traversal and boss reachability remain pending.
- Host multiplayer A20 development selection logs an explicit downgrade warning. This is not live co-op support for Dual King Brands; A20 co-op boss-path behavior remains pending manual verification.
- The misleading multiplayer "game version differs" popup can also mean the vanilla `ModelDb` hash check failed after the visible game version matched. The current package logs host/local version, ModelDb hash, and gameplay-relevant mod-list differences before vanilla disconnects; it does not bypass the hash check.
- Urda source behavior is packaged, but live selection, reward-screen timing, room-entry rewards, act-transition cleanup, save/load, UI, and co-op behavior remain pending.
- Forge Token no longer wraps special rest-site options; live A12 rest/Smith regression testing is still needed before closing that issue.
- Prismatic Gem intentionally skips custom pools, filtered pools, colorless-only pools, no-pool/no-model-modification rewards, elites, bosses, and events; on every second standard reward every visible reward option becomes off-color. If the reward banner hint cannot be updated, `godot.log` should contain a `PrismaticGem reward-screen hint fallback` diagnostic and testers should use the relic hover count plus visible off-color cards as fallback evidence.

## Unsupported Cases

- Enabling legacy `EzDailyContent` and `EZMicroBalance` together is unsupported.
- Other mods that alter card rewards, card pools, rest-site options, Ancient rewards, maps, or Ascension selectors are not compatibility-tested.
- A11-A20 selection is now default-on in this private-beta multiplayer test candidate. The selector patch touches only standard single-player and host-multiplayer lobby selection/start paths, temporarily raises the local single-player run-start max only while launching A11-A20, temporarily expands multiplayer lobby unlock caps only during max recomputation, and skips A11-A20 preferred-progress writes. Set `EZMB_ASCENSION_DISABLE_PUBLIC_SELECTION=1` to restore vanilla A1-A10 selection for comparison; set `EZMB_ASCENSION_DISABLE_MULTIPLAYER_SELECTION=1` to disable only host-multiplayer A11-A20 selection.
- A11 widens maps by 1 column, inserts a reachable optional route node in the new column, and adds route rows by act: Act 1 +1, Act 2 +1, Act 3 +2 without A11-specific map markers or hover tips. A17 inserts one optional 3-4 node Deep Branch in Acts 2/3 for single-player runs when safe saved-map geometry is available and gives enhanced treasure nodes an extra Uncommon relic reward. A19/A20 Boss map points now have Royal Seal / King Brand hover text. A20 uses the vanilla double-boss map path to create/reveal the final-act second Boss, adds Boss 2 Brand metadata/parameters, restores 25% missing HP after Boss 1, adds one Boss card reward before Boss 2, and updates the Boss 1 reward screen header/proceed wording for the inter-boss pause. A20 inserts a fixed courtyard event between Boss 1 rewards and Boss 2. A bespoke full-screen intermission remains unimplemented pending live verification needs.
- Ascension 21-30 and custom-character content are not included.
- Generated art and calibration folders under `art_pipeline/` and `asset/` are not part of the active publish package.
