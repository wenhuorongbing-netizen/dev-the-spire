# Release Evidence Status

Current target: `Spire Plus` manual-test build for user validation. This page is a compact dashboard for evidence state; it does not replace `docs/release-checklist.md`.

Do not mark a row passed from source review alone. A runtime row needs live evidence, logs, screenshots, or an explicit owner-approved deferral.

## Current Package

Source of truth: `docs/issues.md`.

## Automation Summary

This row is not a live verifier row. It records the latest no-game package automation status only.

| Row | Status | Owner | Evidence Needed | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current package automation | Passed | Codex | Build, tests, format, publish, package, artifact tests | Latest hashes are in `docs/issues.md`; rerun after package changes. |

## Verifier Row IDs

These are the exact row IDs required by `scripts/verify-spire-plus-release-evidence.ps1`. Keep a row pending until the matching live files exist or the owner explicitly accepts a deferral and reruns the verifier with `-AllowDeferred`. The beta.17 loader smoke is historical startup evidence only; beta.19 needs a fresh loader row before the verifier can fail closed with 19 remaining manual/live rows.

| Row ID | Kind | Status | Owner | Evidence Needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fresh-current-package-loader-smoke | loader | Pending | User/Codex | Capture beta.19 `godot.log`, clean `godot-log-audit.json`, `loader-smoke-result.json`, current package hash parity, BaseLib plus Spire Plus only, startup completion, stopped game, and restored mod isolation. Historical beta.17 evidence lives at `.tools/runtime-evidence/beta17-loader-smoke-20260525-194311`. |

| ascension-selector-localization | clicked-ui | Pending | User | Character-select A11-A20 Ascension panels show localized titles/descriptions. A20 must show `烙印形态` / `Branded Form`, not raw keys like `ascension.LEVEL_20.title`. |

## Verification Command

When manual evidence folders are filled, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\collect-release-evidence.ps1 -NoLaunch
.\scripts\verify-spire-plus-release-evidence.ps1 -WritePassMarker
```

Use `collect-release-evidence.ps1` to create the verifier-readable manifest and one pending evidence subfolder per required row. Use `-AllowDeferred` only when the project owner explicitly accepts a release-note deferral for a row. `-WritePassMarker` writes `release-evidence-verifier-pass.json` only after all rows pass or are accepted deferrals.

## Runtime Evidence Logs

Set this before launching the game to add grep-friendly evidence lines to `godot.log`:

```powershell
$env:SPIREPLUS_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_LOG='1'
```

Plain marker for scripts and test guards: `SPIREPLUS_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_LOG=1`.
Legacy alias: `EZMB_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_LOG=1`.

Current source guard expects markers on Vakuu fight return paths, Root Eyes, Seed Bank, Rootblight, preview tools, A20 map/combat paths, and co-op gates.

Expected marker format:

```text
[SPIREPLUS-EVIDENCE] <Feature> <Event> run=<run> player=<player> net=<single/host/client> data=<json-ish>
```

The marker helps collect proof; it does not turn a pending row into passed evidence by itself.
