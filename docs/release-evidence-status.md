# Release Evidence Status

Current target: `Spire Plus` manual-test build for user validation. This page is a compact dashboard for evidence state; it does not replace `docs/release-checklist.md`.

Do not mark a row passed from source review alone. A runtime row needs live evidence, logs, screenshots, or an explicit owner-approved deferral.

## Current Package

Source of truth: `docs/issues.md`.

## Automation Summary

This row is not a live verifier row. It records the latest no-game package automation status only.

| Row | Status | Owner | Evidence Needed | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current package automation | Partial | Codex | Build, normal tests, format, package sync, opt-in artifact tests | Latest hashes are in `docs/issues.md`. Beta.96 publish/package sync, installed package parity, runtime preflight, source-workspace checks, and Off loader proof are refreshed; previous beta.93 RitsuLib-only AdditiveBatch1 direct loader smoke remains previous-package registration context only. Gameplay/manual evidence remains pending. |

## Verifier Row IDs

These are the exact row IDs required by `scripts/verify-spire-plus-release-evidence.ps1`. Keep a row pending until the matching live files exist or the owner explicitly accepts a deferral and reruns the verifier with `-AllowDeferred`. The beta.19 loader smoke is historical startup evidence only; the current beta.96 `v0.107.1` RitsuLib-only Off direct loader smoke audited clean for startup/loading proof, and previous beta.93 AdditiveBatch1 remains previous-package registration context only. The beta.96 Mod Settings page row is captured; gameplay, clicked Ancient UI, save-load, preview-tools live behavior, current enabled-mode proof, Vakuu, co-op, and full release-evidence packaging rows remain pending.

| Row ID | Kind | Status | Owner | Evidence Needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fresh-current-package-loader-smoke | loader | Partial | Codex/User | Current Off loader proof exists at `.tools\runtime-evidence\v01071-beta96-ritsulib0431-off-direct-20260621-185056`: clean `godot.log.current-iteration`, clean `godot-log-audit.json`, startup completion, StS1Events disabled with 0 registration lines, and Off packet verifier 43 / 0. Previous beta.93 AdditiveBatch1 proof at `.tools\runtime-evidence\v01071-beta93-ritsulib0431-additivebatch1-direct-20260621` remains previous-package registration context only. To close the formal release-evidence row, add/promote the verifier-required `environment.json`, `package-hashes.json`, and `enabled-mods.txt` alongside current evidence or recapture through the release-evidence collector. |
| mod-settings-current-display | clicked-ui | Pass | Codex | Current beta.96 normal Steam-client Settings -> `Mod Settings (RitsuLib)` proof is under `.tools\runtime-evidence\beta96-ritsulib-mod-settings-clicked-ui-20260621-160701`: foreground Mods list screenshot showing RitsuLib and Spire Plus, foreground Spire Plus config-page screenshots showing Migration Status, `STS2-RitsuLib >= 0.4.31`, evidence-boundary, technical-id, and Preview Tools controls, route note, clean same-session `godot.log`, clean log audit, and filled `mod-settings-checklist.md`. This proves settings UI visibility only, not gameplay or release readiness. |

## Verification Command

When manual evidence folders are filled, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\collect-release-evidence.ps1 -NoLaunch
.\scripts\verify-spire-plus-release-evidence.ps1 -WritePassMarker
```

Use `collect-release-evidence.ps1` to create the verifier-readable manifest and one pending evidence subfolder per required row. Use `-AllowDeferred` only when the project owner explicitly accepts a release-note deferral for a row. `-WritePassMarker` writes `release-evidence-verifier-pass.json` only after all rows pass or are accepted deferrals.

## Runtime Evidence Logs

Set this before launching the game to add grep-friendly evidence lines to `godot.log`:

```powershell
$env:SPIREPLUS_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_LOG='1'
```

Plain marker for scripts and test guards: `SPIREPLUS_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_LOG=1`.
Legacy alias: `EZMB_RELEASE_EVIDENCE_LOG=1`.

Current source guard expects markers on Vakuu fight return paths, Root Eyes, Seed Bank, Rootblight, preview tools, A20 map/combat paths, and co-op gates.

Expected marker format:

```text
[SPIREPLUS-EVIDENCE] <Feature> <Event> run=<run> player=<player> net=<single/host/client> data=<json-ish>
```

The marker helps collect proof; it does not turn a pending row into passed evidence by itself.
